/*
Example explained
Line 1: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, 
such as printf() (used in line 4). Header files add functionality to C programs.

Line 2: A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.

Line 3: Another thing that always appear in a C program, is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

Line 4: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In our example it will output "Hello World".

Note: Every C statement ends with a semicolon ;

//2. C New Lines

  printf("Hello World!\n");
  printf("I am learning C.");
  // 2nd way
printf("Hello World!\nI am learning C.\nAnd it is awesome!");
//3rd way
 printf("Hello World!\n\n");
  printf("I am learning C.");

//3. some others escape characters

//	printf("My name is "varsha");
	// a) \t
  printf("Hello World!\t");
  printf("I am learning C.");
  //b) 
    printf("Hello World!\\");
  printf("I am learning C.");
  //c) 
  printf("They call him \'varsha\'.");
